[We are skipping lessons 1 & 2]

I. Lesson 3 - Reading the Bit Rate

* Your Prototocol: List the steps and rules of your protocol here.

* Performance - what bit rate were you able to achieve?
Bits Transmitted:
Time in Seconds:
Bit Rate: __ bits/sec

* Reflection quiz:

II. Lesson 5 - Binary Practice

* All 4-bit numbers: (use tab to create a table)
0000	0
0001	1
0010	2
...

* 8-bit numbers with exactly one 1:
0000 0001	1
0000 0010	2
0000 0100	
0000 1000	
0001 0000	
0010 0000	
0100 0000	
1000 0000	

* Conversion Practice!
Binary to decimal
100
101
1101
0001 1111
0010 0000
1010 1010
1111 1111

Decimal to binary
5
17
63
64
127
256
513

Show your work: explain the math you can use to convert from binary to decimal. Use for an example: 10101010.

Show your work: Can you explain the math needed to convert from decimal to binary? Use 79 as an example.

III. Hexadecimal Interlude

Show your work: How would you convert from hexadecimal to decimal? Typing out the small math problems you use to get there is a good way of showing it.

How can you convert back from decimal to hex? 


IV. Lesson 6 - Sending numbers

Explain the steps of your protocol. 

How does the recipient know when one number ends and the other begins?

Do you need to modify the protocol when using a larger grid?


V. Lesson 7

Not graded :)
